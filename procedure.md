The experiment is designed to understand and learn color models and processing in color domains. This experiment consists two parts

(i) Color Spaces

(ii) Color Processing

Steps to run the experiments

(i) Color Spaces

1. Select image from the mosaic using 'select image' option

a) Select region of the image to load it in the input image panel

2. Select one option from color spaces

a) HIS

b) CMY

c) YCbCr

3. Select run option to perform the operations

a) Output result will be displayed in the output panel

(A) Processing:

1. Select image from the mosaic using 'select image' option

a. Select region of the image to load it in the input image panel

2. Select one option from color spaces

3. Select one or more plane from color space to apply parameters

4. Select the one option from Linear and Histogram processing

a. For Linear select the value of slope and offset

b. For Histogram processing select one option from Global histogram equalization and Adaptive Histogram equalization

5. Select run option to perform the operations

a. Output result will be displayed in the output panel

Interesting Observations

1. Try Linear processing with one color plane Vs all color planes and observe the result.

2. Try Histogram equalization with one color plane Vs all color plane and observe the result.
